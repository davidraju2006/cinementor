## 🎥 What Is Cinematography at an Advanced Level?
Cinematography is **visual storytelling**.

At beginner level, you learn:
- Shot types
- Basic angles

At intermediate level, you learn:
- WHY to move the camera
- HOW lenses affect emotion
- WHEN visuals speak louder than dialogue

---

## 🎥 Camera Movement & Meaning

### 1️⃣ Static Camera
Used when:
- Scene is calm
- Emotion is internal
- Audience must observe

Example:
➡️ A character processing bad news.

---

### 2️⃣ Pan & Tilt
Used to:
- Reveal information
- Follow action
- Show power relationships

Rule:
> Move camera ONLY when story demands it.

---

### 3️⃣ Dolly & Tracking Shots
Creates:
- Immersion
- Emotional connection

Example:
➡️ Following a character walking toward destiny.

---

## 🔍 Lens Selection & Emotion

### Wide Lens (18–35mm)
- Distortion
- Isolation
- Energy

Used in:
- Horror
- Drama
- Psychological scenes

---

### Normal Lens (35–50mm)
- Natural look
- Human perspective

Used in:
- Dialogues
- Emotional realism

---

### Telephoto Lens (85mm+)
- Compression
- Distance
- Intimacy

Used in:
- Romance
- Observation
- Emotional isolation

---

## 🌊 Depth of Field
Depth of field controls **focus and attention**.

- Shallow focus → Emotion
- Deep focus → World & context

---

## ✍️ Practice Task
Shoot a short scene:
- Once with static camera
- Once with movement

Observe emotional difference.

## ✍️ From Idea to Screenplay
At this level, scripts are no longer random scenes.
They have:
- Character arcs
- Subtext
- Pacing

---

## 👤 Character Depth
Every character must have:
- Desire
- Fear
- Contradiction

Example:
➡️ A brave police officer who fears losing family.

---

## 🔄 Character Arc
A character must CHANGE.

Types of arcs:
- Growth arc
- Fall arc
- Tragic arc

---

## 🗣 Dialogue with Subtext
Good dialogue is NOT literal.

❌ "I am angry with you"
✅ "You never call anymore"

Meaning is hidden.

---

## ⏱ Scene Pacing
Scenes should:
- Enter late
- Exit early

Avoid unnecessary greetings and goodbyes.

---

## ✍️ Practice Task
Rewrite a scene:
- Remove obvious dialogue
- Let visuals and silence speak

## 💡 Lighting as Storytelling
Lighting communicates:
- Mood
- Power
- Genre

Advanced lighting is about **control**.

---

## 🎭 Genre-Based Lighting

### Horror
- Low key
- High contrast
- Shadows dominate

### Romance
- Soft light
- Warm tones
- Smooth transitions

### Action
- High contrast
- Hard light
- Strong direction

---

## 🕯 Practical Lights
Using lamps, bulbs, candles in frame:
- Makes scene realistic
- Motivates light source

---

## 🎨 Color Temperature
- Warm (3200K) → Comfort
- Cool (5600K) → Isolation

Mixing temperatures creates tension.

---

## ✍️ Practice Task
Light one scene in:
- Warm version
- Cold version

Compare emotional impact.
